<title>Managing Images</title>

In a cloud environment, Virtual Machines are instantiated from images. These 
images are registered in an Image Management Service, in our case provided by 
the Glance OpenStack component.

<title>Public Images</title>
<para>
Some images in the CloudVeneto are provided by the Cloud 
administrators. These images are public, and visible to all users.
They appear with <replaceable>Visibility</replaceable> equal to 
<replaceable>Public</replaceable>
in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Compute</guimenu><guisubmenu>Images</guisubmenu></menuchoice>

<para>
Users can provide their own images
and upload them to the Cloud Image service:
these images are private, meaning that they are only available to the users 
of the project they are uploaded for.
</para>

<note><para>
Users are not allowed to publish public (i.e. available to all projects) 
images.
</para></note>


<para>
Many open source projects such as Ubuntu and Fedora now produce pre-built 
images which can be used for certain clouds. If these are available, it is 
much easier to use them compared to building your own.

<itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><ulink url="https://getfedora.org/cloud/">Fedora repository</ulink></para></listitem> 
   <listitem><para><ulink url="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu repository</ulink></para></listitem> 
</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Using an Ubuntu image as an example, after you downloaded the
image from the relevant web site, to upload such image 
using the command line tools you need to:

<itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>Authenticate to OpenStack using the openrc source:
      <screen>
$ . demo-openrc.sh
      </screen>
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>Issue th following command:
      <screen>
$ openstack image create --private --disk-format=qcow2 \
      --container-format=bare \
      --file trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img ubuntu-trusty
      </screen>
   </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Once loaded, the image can then be used to create virtual machines. 
</para>

<para>
Some system software is delivered in ISO image format. 
For example, these steps show how to create an image from the Freedos ISO 
available from <ulink url="http://www.freedos.org/download/download/fd11src.iso">here</ulink>

<screen>
$ openstack image create --private --disk-format=iso \
--container-format=bare --file=fd11src.iso freedos11
</screen>
</para>


<note><para>
In the CloudVeneto cloud image size is limited to 25 GB.
</para></note>


<warning><para>
No backup is currently done on user provided images or snapshots.
Therefore users with private images should keep a copy of the images they 
have uploaded in their private archives. 
</para></warning>

<section id="SharingImages">
<title>Sharing Images</title>
<para>
As mentioned before, users are not allowed to publish public images.
However images can be shared between different projects. This is currently only
possible via the command line tools.
</para>

<para>
If an image has been uploaded to your currently active project, using the
procedure described in 
<xref linkend="UserProvidedImages"/>, 
you can then use the <command>openstack image add project</command> operation to 
share that image with another project.
</para>

<para>
To share an image, first source the project profile for the 
project containing the image you want to share (e.g. Fedora-Cloud-Base-27)
and find its id with
the <command>openstack image list</command> command
(d4b02b71-755e-47ad-bb27-1ea5c23bf7cb in the 
example):

<screen>
$ openstack image list
+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+
| ID                                   | Name                 | Status |
+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+
| 7ebe160d-5498-477b-aa2e-94a6d962a075 | CentOS7              | active |
| d4b02b71-755e-47ad-bb27-1ea5c23bf7cb | Fedora-Cloud-Base-27 | active |
| 071668fc-dfeb-4956-996a-d2a487755709 | cirros               | active |
+--------------------------------------+----------------------+--------+

</screen>

</para>

<para>
You then need to change (to 'Shared' the visibility of the image:

<screen>
openstack image set --property visibility=shared d4b02b71-755e-47ad-bb27-1ea5c23bf7cb
</screen>

</para>


<para>
You now need to find the id of the project you wish to share the image with. 
This will generally be done by looking at the openrc file of that project and 
finding the <literal>OS_PROJECT_ID</literal> variable (in this example, it is 
e81df4c0b493439abb8b85bfd4cbe071).
</para>

<para>
To share the image with id d4b02b71-755e-47ad-bb27-1ea5c23bf7cb
to the project whose is is e81df4c0b493439abb8b85bfd4cbe071, use the command:

<screen>
$ openstack image add project d4b02b71-755e-47ad-bb27-1ea5c23bf7cb e81df4c0b493439abb8b85bfd4cbe071

</screen>
</para>

<para>
A member of the target project (with id e81df4c0b493439abb8b85bfd4cbe071 in our example)
needs to accept the image in order to be available in the images list:

<screen>
$ openstack image set --accept d4b02b71-755e-47ad-bb27-1ea5c23bf7cb
</screen>

</para>

<para>
In the target project, the image will appear in the image list:

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
  <imagedata condition="web" fileref="./images/SharedImage.png"/>
  <imagedata condition="pdf" fileref="./images/SharedImage.png" width="450" />

Users can also build custom images, that can then been uploaded in

There are several tools providing support for image creation. Some of them                   
are described in the
