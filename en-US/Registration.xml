For what concerns the <menuchoice><guimenu>Project Action</guimenu></menuchoice>
(projects have been discussed in <xref linkend="Projects"/>) you 
have three options:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select Existing Projects</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Create new project</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Choose <literal>Select Existing Projects</literal> if you want to apply
membership for one or more existing projects (choose them in the relevant
box).
</para>

<para>
Select <literal>Create new project</literal> if instead you want to ask
the creation of a new project (and you are the leader of the experiment/research 
group associated to this project).
In this case you will have to specify also
a Project name and a Project Description. At the end of the Project Description you have to specify
the Department / Institution your project belong to (i.e xxxx - INFN or xxxx - Biology Dept). 
You will also have to specify
if this project must be private (a personal project where you will
be the only member) or not.
</para>

<para>
Newly created projects will get a default quota of:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>20 VCPU</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>40 GB RAM</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>200 GB for Volume (e.g. non ephemeral) storage</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Allocation of more resources for UniPD users must be approved by the Cloud UniPD "governance".
Mail your request to <email>cloud-unipd-gov@lists.pd.infn.it</email> 
if you want more resources to be allocated to your project.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Public (i.e. not private) projects are projects where other users can apply
for membership. They are supposed to be used for experiments or other research
groups.
</para>
<para><literal>Personal private projects are discouraged</literal> and are created 
only for convincing reasons. </para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The person who asks for the creation of a new project is automatically
defined as the manager of this project, i.e. he/she will have to
manage the membership requests for this project. So the request to create a new
project should be done by the relevant experiment/group leader.
